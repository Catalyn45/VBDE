# VBDE

VBDE (Very Best Development Environment) is a set of tools to set-up the best
development environment possible. It is some sort of very minimalist 
"desktop environment" but very fast and super good looking. It have a lot of
shortcuts so you can move blazingly fast!!

# Notes

The installer is known to work on Fedora and Arch. It will probably fail
on other distributions because of the package names differences, so if you are
using Debian/Ubuntu you kinda need to figure it out yourself.

# Usage

1. run setup.sh
```
./setup.sh
```
2. run startx to start the i3wm
```
startx
```
3. enjoy! ^_^
